## üå∫ Hello & Welcome

Hi there! I‚Äôm Sierra Layla Vithica - a web developer and software engineer based in the cozy, rainy heart of Seattle, WA. I‚Äôve been in love with code ever since I was little and learned it could feel just like writing poetry. There‚Äôs a quiet magic in writing clean, expressive code that solves a human-centric problem with elegance and grace.

To me, software development isn‚Äôt dry or overly complicated; it‚Äôs an evolving art form. I thrive on self-education and believe curiosity is the best fuel in this ever-changing field. There‚Äôs always something new to explore and that‚Äôs what makes this journey so exciting.


## üìö My Background in Tech

I hold a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science (graduated with honors from Millersville University of Pennsylvania in 2012), and I‚Äôve been working professionally ever since. Over the years, I‚Äôve had the joy of building everything from large-scale custom CRM platforms to elegant marketing websites across a wide array of industries.

For about a decade, I specialized in WordPress development for B2B and B2C clients, but more recently I‚Äôve fallen in love with modern, progressive web stacks - headless architecture, JAMstack, microservices, all the good stuff. These days, I‚Äôm a Senior Software Engineer at Bear Group, where I focus heavily on Shopify development: headless builds, custom themes, bespoke apps, and Checkout UI extensions.


## ü™¥ The Human Side of Me

Behind the keyboard, I‚Äôm just a soft-hearted, slightly anxious, neurodivergent girl navigating the world in her own way. I‚Äôm autistic, ADHD, and proudly transgender (she/her üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è). I live in Seattle with my beautiful polycule of four amazing partners who fill my life with love, laughter, and plenty of nerdy joy on the daily.

When I‚Äôm not building something on the web, you can probably find me curled up with my Steam Deck, tinkering with code, playing MTG, collecting Pok√©mon cards, or wandering around the city on a quiet walk. I‚Äôm also a huge lover of uplifting trance music. There‚Äôs something about those soaring melodies and emotional drops (hello, Gareth Emery!) that just fills my heart to the brim with joy.


## üíå Let‚Äôs Connect

If anything here resonates, feel free to reach out! I love connecting with other thoughtful developers, creative minds, and kind souls. Whether you‚Äôre building something cool, want to swap tech tips, or just share playlists - my inbox is always open.
